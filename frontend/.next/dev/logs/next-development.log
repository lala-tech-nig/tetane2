Ecmascript file had an error
  1 | // 'use client';
> 2 | import { useState } from 'react';
    |          ^^^^^^^^
  3 | import Link from 'next/link';
  4 | import { useAuth } from '@/context/AuthContext';
  5 | import styles from '../login/page.module.css'; // Reusing styles

You're importing a component that needs `useState`. This React Hook only works in a Client Component. To fix, mark the file (or its parent) with the `"use client"` directive.
